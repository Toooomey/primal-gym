## [Live Webite - Github Pages](https://toooomey.github.io/primal-gym/)

This website is to showcase a fictional local gym based in Llandaff Fields, looking to gain exposure and
attract new members to the club while providing users details of the facilities available.

The main aim is to build an HTML and CSS based website, incorporating the use of Boostrap in certain elements, which is responsive and easy to use. This is for 
the User Centric Frontend Development Project.
