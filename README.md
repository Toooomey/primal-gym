![Mockup](https://i3.lensdump.com/i/gNcAED.png)

## [Live Webite - Github Pages](https://toooomey.github.io/primal-gym/)

This website is to showcase a fictional local gym based in Llandaff Fields, looking to gain exposure and
attract new members to the club while providing users details of the facilities available.

The main aim is to build an HTML and CSS based website, incorporating the use of Boostrap in certain elements, which is responsive and easy to use. This is for 
the User Centric Frontend Development Project.

## Issues found during site development


## Performance testing

I run [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check performance of the website.
I had to do couple of changes to improve performance. Screenshots are presented below:

![bug_performance1](testing/performance1.png)
![bug_performance2](testing/performance2.png)

Final results:
![performance_final](testing/performance_final.png)
I noticed that this tests scores vary from time to time and depends on external libraries as well. 



## Code Validation
 At the and of the project I used two websites to validate a code
 
 * [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS
 * [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML
